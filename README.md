Academicians Merit Smartcontract

For lecturers and (students?)
Owner University/Faculty Administrator

Current Problem : 
-	Academician (mostly lecturer especially me) always forgetful, too many achievement, too litle time to keep the record.. yes we are lazy
-	Periodically data assesment scattered across the year, difficult to gathering it all
-	Long time wait to submit and verify to university for getting a merit
-	Merit not recorded well, both users and administrator always lost track of individual history achievement
-	Need effort to display/show the verified achievement to external/internal party (partners and other universities)

Solution:
-	Put it in blockchain! immutable, trust, unhack, shareable
-	Make coin as a meritpoint. Point can be use as promotion and faculty accreditation
-	Owner/Administrator check periodically entry from academician to verify the achievement
-	Each academician have their own wallet, each transaction recorded for the rest of the blockchain life 😊
-	Each user could display/show their verified achievement by sharing the block key

Future challenge :
-	Web3 Interface  interactive and helpful UI  “create a frontend for my smart contract. allow users to connect and interact with it using RainbowKit”
-	User whitelist  its imposible to put thousand record of whitelisted academician In single smartcontracts
-	Implementation Polkadot special function smartcontract ?
